1. Enter openai_key.\n

3. enter git diff. (git diff --cached | pbcopy after git add will copy it.)\n
4. Press the Submit button.
If your git diff is too large, it won't work.\n
Make sure to keep it small. It is recommended to use one file or one hader + one related file.\n

    The commit message should be structured as follows:
    ```
    <type>[optional scope]: <description>

    [optional body]

    [optional footer]
    ```
    Type:
    This specifies the type of commit. Common types are:

    feat: Introduces a new feature to the codebase.
    fix: Fixes a bug.
    chore: Routine tasks or maintenance.
    docs: Documentation changes.
    style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
    refactor: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature.
    perf: Performance improvements.
    test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing ones.
    Scope (Optional):
    This specifies the part of the codebase the commit pertains to, e.g., auth, ui, api, etc. The scope is enclosed in parentheses.

    Description:
    A brief description of the commit. It should:

    Use the imperative mood: "add" not "added", "fix" not "fixed".
    Not end with a period.
    Body (Optional):
    Provides a more detailed explanation of the commit. This is separated from the description by an empty line.

    Footer (Optional):
    This is where you'd reference any issues related to the commit, e.g., "Closes #123", "Related #456".

    Breaking Changes:
    If a commit introduces changes that break backward compatibility, it should have BREAKING CHANGE: in its footer or body. This is then followed by a description of what changed and its implications."""

    Type:

    fix: A bug fix.
    docs: Documentation-only changes.
    style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
    refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
    perf: A code change that improves performance.
    test: Adding missing or correcting existing tests.
    chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation.
    Scope (Optional):
    Refers to the module or part of the codebase affected by the change, e.g., router, http, cli, etc. This provides additional contextual information.

    Short Summary:

    Provides a concise description of the changes.
    Uses imperative mood: "add" not "added", "change" not "changed".
    Doesn't end with a period.
    Body (Optional):

    Elaborates on the details of the commit.
    Explains the motivation for the change, contrasting its current behavior with the new behavior.
    Uses imperative mood: "add" not "added", "change" not "changed".
    Footer (Optional):

    Contains any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.

    Emoji Selection:
    The emoji at the beginning of the commit message should reflect the primary purpose or the main change made in the commit. Some commonly used emojis include:

    ‚ú® (:sparkles:) for introducing a new feature.
    üêõ (:bug:) for fixing a bug.
    üìö (:books:) for documentation changes.
    üé® (:art:) to improve the structure or format of the code.
    ‚ôªÔ∏è (:recycle:) for refactoring code.
    üöÄ (:rocket:) to improve performance.
    üîí (:lock:) for addressing security concerns.
    ... and many more.
    The Gitmoji guide provides a comprehensive list of emojis and their associated meanings.

    Short Description:
    A concise and clear description of the change made. Ideally, it should:

    Use the imperative mood, e.g., "add" not "added", "fix" not "fixed".
